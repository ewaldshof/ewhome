# ewhome 0.8.0

EWHome is a system to conveniently configure a set of microcontroller boards to perform control operations for example in a smart home. The boards can be integrated into a smart home system like Home Assistant or FHEM for monitoring and setting parameters. But unlike a centralized system the EWHome will keep performing there control tasks when the server or even the complete network are down.
